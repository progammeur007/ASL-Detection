# ASL Detection using Deep Learning 🖐️🤟

This project is a **deep learning-based American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet detection system**.  
It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify ASL hand signs into their respective alphabet classes.

## 📊 Dataset Format

- **Train Data:** `asl_alphabet_train/` contains **subfolders for each class (A, B, C, ..., space, nothing, del)**.
- **Test Data:** `asl_alphabet_test/` contains images in a **flat folder** (filenames start with their class, e.g. `A_123.jpg`).
